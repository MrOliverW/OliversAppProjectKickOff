I spent over an hour setting up my Project Kickoff Document in Confluence and when I when to download it, it removed all my data and didn't offer me a way to restore it. Some of the formatting may not be as visually appealing as the Confluence template but the information is the same.

	Collaboration & Communication Plan:
	Tools: We will track our tasks via Asana
1.	We will use Google Workspace for Document Sharing & Collaboration 
2.	We will use Discord for Communication 
	Progress Tracking & Reporting: Tasks will be managed and tracke din Asana.
	See Oliver Warlick for getting access to your Asana, Workspace and to Discord.
	Risk & Issue Management:
	Initial Risks: 
1.	Overbudget
	We will work closely with our business planning team to ensure our costs stay as they supposed to be. 
	In the event we need additional resources, we will determine the best course of action based on the rate of resource depletion
2.	Behind Schedule
	If we are behind schedule, we will consider deploying additional resources to acquire more employees.
	We will work closely with the operations team to determine if a deadline should be moved.
3.	App is not yet satisfactory
	If we are struggling to develop a user-friendly app, we will consider deploying additional resources for extra employes.
	We will have an operations meeting to determine the best course of action.
	Assumptions: 
1.	We know how much funding we have available for this project
2.	We know our app developers have what it takes to build this app
3.	We know there is a community of testers willing to test our product for free



	Immediate Next Steps (Action Plan): 
1.	Following this meeting, our operations team (founder, business developer, software developer, QA manager) will meet to brainstorm app concepts. 
2.	Our QA manager and tester will meet to create SOPs for testing the app
3.	We will setup our Asana, Workspace, and Discord accounts
	Open Questions: 
1.	Will we ever consider adding multi-lingual support for app?
a.	Possibly, once we reach our milestone of 1,000 happy users
2.	How often will the operations team meet to discuss app development and progress?
3.	What is the best way for QA to report bugs?
4.	How much will Oliver be involved in the software development process?
